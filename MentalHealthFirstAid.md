# Information about these notes

## ALGEE mental health first aid action plan

* Assess for risk of suicide or harm
* Listen nonjudgmentally
* Give reassurance and information
* Encourage appropriate professional help
* Encourage self-help and other support strategies

The ALGEE plan…

* Can be used in any order
* Can be used selectively; it is not required to use every step of the plan every time you do MHFA.

Key question that came up during our meeting:

* What might happen an hour from now? Where will this person be? Will they be okay. 

## Suicide screening

Steps:

1. Assess
2. Ask the question
3. Ask about planning
4. Get help immediately

Full procedure:

* Are you thinking about killing yourself?
* Are you thinking about suicide?

If yes:

* Have you thought about how you would kill yourself?
* Have you decided when you would do it?
* Have you done anything to get the things you need to kill yourself?

If yes:

* Call 911. Tell the dispatcher that the person is at risk for suicide. If available, ask for a mental health crisis professional. 
* Connect the person to the appropriate professional help.

## Symptoms of mental health challenges


* Withdrawing from others
* Low energy
* Sadness
* Excessive worry and fear
* Irritability
* Mood swings
* Drug or alcohol abuse

* Early symptoms: not enjoying work/activities/hobbies, sadness, worry
* Worsening symptoms: more sadness/worry, hopelessness, rage, despair
* Crisis symptoms: big mood changes, feeling trapped

Symptoms are a challenge when…

* They happen frequently (most of day; many times a day)
* Long duration
* Impair work performance, relationships, usual activity

## Signs of mental health challenges

* Early signs: lateness, change in work, canceling commitments, tiredness, disheveled clothing
* Worsening signs: withdrawing from friends and family, odd behavior for that person, worse hygiene, agitation, indecision, trouble focusing
* Crisis signs: threatening to hurt or kill, recklessness, substance misuse, vomiting, difficulty breathing

**4-6 weeks is a common break point between distress from a one-time incident and a chronic challenge. My trainer mentioned something like this, but also added that this is very nonlinear and could be unique for each person.**

## Reminders

* Talk privately.
* Don’t pressure the person to talk right away. 
* Use your normal way of talking with the person. 
* Don’t confuse feelings (feeling depressed or nervous) with diagnosable medical conditions (depressive or anxiety disorders).
* It is okay and encouraged to use phrases like “you don’t seem like yourself lately”
* Never give advice. Just suggest talking to a professional. 
* It is good/fine to offer to sit with the person while they make a call to a professional resource. 
* It is good to follow up and check with someone a few days after you first talked. 
* Remind person to do more things they enjoy. 
* No obligation to ever apply mental health first aid skills
* MHFA does not supersede any professional responsibilities
* MHFA does not diagnose or treat


## Showing support

* Individual- visit person at home and wish them well. 
* Workplace- offer to take on extra work to ease burden on the person. 
* Community- offer to help with daily activities. 

MHFAer can also help reduce stigma of mental health challenges. 

# Questions

## Pending

1. **Is talking in person the only recommended way to ask someone if they are feeling okay? What about phone calls, e-mails, and text messages?**

1. **Are there any unique considerations involved when the person we are concerned about is a student at our institution? When and how should we involve others at our institution? Obviously each institution will have its own rules and guidelines, but it’s still relevant to discuss some general principles. Additionally, all of us in this training do work together and this is a good opportunity (BA’s question is related; what would we do at our institute?).**

1. **What resources should we give to someone who is open to meeting with a professional? Most situations presumably won’t call for calling one of the phone numbers. They’ll find a mental health professional through their insurance, for example.**

1. **Did I finish all the pre-work? The system told me I did but then I got a reminder that I didn’t.**

## Addressed during presentation

1. **What should I do if I suspect someone is having a mental health challenge but they don’t bring it up themselves?**

1. **Should I approach an interaction with a stranger differently than an interaction with someone I already know?**

1. **What is your advice about the situation in which the person we approach does not want to talk at all? Ask for suggestions from someone else? Do nothing?** 

1. **All of us have some of these signs and symptoms. Can it be hard to tell when it is and isn’t something that requires attention?**
